# Degree-Corrected Block Model: A New Approach and Efficient Initialization for Inference

We use **OtrisymNMF** as a **degree corrected block model (DCBM)** to detect communities in several benchmark networks, including the LFR benchmark. 
We also demonstrate that our initialization, based on separable NMF, significantly improves the results of classical inference methods for the **DCBM of Karrer and Newman**.

All the tools for OtrisymNMF are available in the Python package **OtrisymNMF**. For Karrer and Newman's DCBM and inference methods, we used the **pysbm** package.
The Karate notebook compares the use of OtrisymNMF and Karrer and Newman's DCBM on the **Karate Club network**.
The other files contain experiments demonstrating that the SVCA initialization significantly improves the results of inference methods.

# Reproduce the results

# OtrisymNMFThis package provides implementations of the **Orthogonal Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Tri-Factorization** (OtrisymNMF) algorithm  as proposed in the paper:

**Dache, Alexandra, Arnaud Vandaele, and Nicolas Gillis.**  
*"Orthogonal Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Tri-Factorization."*  
IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP), 2024.  
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), United States.

The algorithm aims to solve the following optimization problem:

$$
\min_{W \geq 0, S \geq 0} \|X - WSW^T\|_F^2 \quad \text{s.t.} \quad W^TW = I
$$

Where:
- **X** is a given symmetric nonnegative matrix (e.g., adjacency matrix of an undirected graph).
- **W** is a matrix representing the assignment of elements to **r** communities.
- **S** is a central matrix describing interactions between communities.

The **OtrisymNMF** package also includes the **SVCA** algorithm to initialize the inference.
